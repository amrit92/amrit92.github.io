I would like to refer Amrit Sahoo, doing his Masters in Computer Science at Arizona State University who is looking for a full-time position as a Software Engineer (Graduating May 2018). I have known him for quite some time and I feel he would be a great fit for the job. He has recently interned at Walmart Labs building tools to process millions of transactions from Walmart stores. He has prior work experience of two years as a Software Engineer in product based companies and has also done well in a few international programming contests like the ACM ICPC.
